    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crispy fried chicken is a beloved dish known for its crunchy, golden-brown exterior and juicy, flavorful interior. This recipe combines a well-seasoned buttermilk marinade with a perfectly spiced flour coating to create chicken that’s crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika
        </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
        </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder
        </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for a spicy kick)
        </li>
        <li>1 kg chicken pieces (legs, thighs, wings, and breasts), skin-on
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). Add the chicken pieces to the bowl, ensuring they are fully submerged in the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to penetrate the chicken.</li>
        <li>In a separate large bowl or shallow dish, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, baking powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). Mix well to ensure the spices are evenly distributed throughout the flour.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade, allowing any excess buttermilk to drip off. Dredge each piece of chicken in the seasoned flour mixture, pressing firmly to ensure the flour adheres well. Shake off any excess flour. Place the coated chicken pieces on a wire rack and let them sit for about 10-15 minutes. This helps the coating to set and adhere better during frying.</li>
        <li>In a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, pour enough oil to fill it about halfway. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C). You can use a deep-fry thermometer to check the temperature.</li>
        <li>Carefully place a few pieces of chicken into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry in batches if necessary. Fry the chicken for about 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the coating is golden brown and crispy, and the chicken is cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C).</li>
    </ol>
